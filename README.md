# tuig

*and tuig-iosys, too!*

[tuig] is a game engine hyperfocused on textmode, systemic games.
[tuig-iosys] is the textmode input/output system it uses.

They live in the same repo because they're pretty tightly tied together.
You can use tuig-iosys on its own, and using tuig doesn't require understanding the most complex parts of tuig-iosys, but the design of each informs the other.
