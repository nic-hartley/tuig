/// Takes text input, analogous to `<input type="text">`, with hooks for autocompletion, history, etc.
///
/// `TextInput` is meant to take a single line of input, and it doesn't really do anything with extra vertical space
/// it's attached to. If the input is longer than the space is wide, the input scrolls left and right to keep the
/// cursor in view, biasing towards the end, and cutting off the ends with a `â€¦`.
///
/// You'll need to keep the actual element around, because it tracks some pieces of state:
/// - Currently in-progress input
/// - Cursor position within the line
/// - Autocomplete-related things
///
/// Accordingly, [`Attachment`] is implemented for `&mut TextInput`, not `TextInput` itself, so you'll use it like:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use tuig_iosys::ui::{Region, elements::{TextInput, TextInputResult}};
/// let region = //...
/// # Region::empty();
/// let text_input = // ...
/// # TextInput::new();
/// match region.attach(&mut text_input) {
///   TextInputResult::Nothing => (),
///   TextInputResult::Autocomplete { text, res } => *res = text.into(),
///   TextInputResult::Submit(s) => println!("enter pressed: {}", s),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [`Region::attach`]ing this will return a [`TextInputResult`], which is how you'll interact with autocomplete. To
/// use the history features, see [`TextInput::store`].
